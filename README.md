Each of the food types that were tracked in the income_consumption data were extracted from this data and grouped into the food type. For instance Apple juice, Apples, and Apples dried, were all combined by calories consumed. This data set was used to provide a ratio that adjusted consumption data from 2007 to 2017.|[https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-availability-per-capita-data-system/food-availability-per-capita-data-system/#Loss-Adjusted%20Food%20Availability](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-availability-per-capita-data-system/food-availability-per-capita-data-system/#Loss-Adjusted%20Food%20Availability)|
